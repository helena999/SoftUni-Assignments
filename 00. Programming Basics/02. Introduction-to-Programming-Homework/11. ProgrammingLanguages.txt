C# is one of the programming languages designed for the Common Language Infrastructure. CSharp is widely used in Application development. CSharp is compiled to an intermediate language. It tries to stay closer to C/C++ and took a vague inspiraton from VB on those concepts that weren't mappable to C/C++. CSharp is definetely close to Java, but Java is influenced by Smalltalk.
